## 📝 Introduction  

**Sudoku Unlimited** is a dynamic and interactive Sudoku game developed using **Flutter**. As an absolute beginner, I always had ideas but struggled with executing and completing them.

Since this is my **first project**, there may be **inefficiencies in the code due to my beginner-level skills and AI-assisted coding**. If you come across any issues or potential improvements, **your contributions would be greatly appreciated!** 🚀
